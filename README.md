## code snippets

"rafce" to crete react arrow function component

## Technologies used
React is the main framework used here. 
I have also used "react router" to route to different (sign in) page. 
"styled-component" is used for CSS-in-JS approach. 
"react scroll" is used for smooth scrolling effects when clicked on navigation icon.
